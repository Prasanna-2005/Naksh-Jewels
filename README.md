# Naksh Jewels ‚Äî Jewelry Homepage (API Driven)

Hi 
This is a **jewelry website homepage** made using **Next.js**, **Tailwind-Material CSS**, and a few cool animation libraries like **GSAP** and **Framer Motion**.

---


>  I'm good at backend. I‚Äôve mostly worked with APIs, logic, and data handling. 
>  When it comes to frontend, I‚Äôm still learning ‚Äî but I love using Tailwind CSS because it's easier and cleaner than plain CSS. 
>  I recently discovered GSAP and Velocity.js, and I use AI tools to help bring creative UI ideas to life.
